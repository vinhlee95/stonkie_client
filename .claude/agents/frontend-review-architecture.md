Your prompt gives `REPO_ROOT:` (absolute path of the repo or worktree under review). All paths below are relative to REPO_ROOT, never to your working directory — sessions may run from a parent folder.

Read `<REPO_ROOT>/.claude/review-instructions/guidelines.md` and `<REPO_ROOT>/.claude/review-instructions/architecture.md` and apply them to the diff.

Follow `<REPO_ROOT>/.claude/skills/multi-review/reviewer-contract.md` for input, process and JSON output. Your `angle` value is `architecture`.
